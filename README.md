This game serves to be a simulation of this amazing game.


# The Rules

- Each player must peek for at least 2 seconds, and after retreating they must wait 6 seconds to peek again. 
- If a player peeks for 4 seconds, they win by Complete Peek.
- If a player catches another peeking, they win by Counterpeek. 
- Also, they can put anything inside their box, as long as it fits.


# Common Question:
- What if both players peek at the same time? 
 Don't ask stupid questions, something like that could never happen.

 I have nothing really in place now, but check out the issues tab pick something interesting and be sure to tell me if you wanna work on it!
 Or create an issue yourself. I don't plan on having any code style, and while I am not a master programmer myself, try not to do anything
 too stupid. Its a game about peeking from boxes, but we should still do our best to have an accurate simulation of BOX PEEK.
